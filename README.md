# Metaheuristic N-Queen

This repository contains a C# project that solves the N-Queen problem using metaheuristic algorithms, specifically Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing.

## Description

The Metaheuristic N-Queen project aims to find a solution to the N-Queen problem using two popular metaheuristic algorithms:

- Genetic Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing

The N-Queen problem involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The project provides an implementation of both algorithms to search for a valid solution and minimize the number of conflicts between the queens.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ilia-Abolhasani/metaheuristic-n-queen.git
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.

3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.

4. Run the application to start solving the N-Queen problem using metaheuristic algorithms.

## Usage

To use the Metaheuristic N-Queen project, follow these steps:

1. Launch the application.

2. Specify the size of the chessboard (N) and the number of queens to be placed.

3. Select the metaheuristic algorithm (Genetic Algorithm or Simulated Annealing) to use for solving the problem.

4. Click the "Run" button to start the algorithm.

5. Monitor the progress and the number of conflicts as the algorithm searches for a solution.

6. Once a valid solution is found, it will be displayed, indicating the positions of the queens on the chessboard.

7. Analyze the results and evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithm for solving the N-Queen problem.
